This is prototype demo code, no guarantees.

To run this demo, open the TexMexTacosBot.sln file in Visual Studio 2017.
Community Edition was used to create it.

Make sure to update all the NuGet packages and build before running it.

You will need to update the Microsoft Bot Framework keys 
in the web.config file as described in the course. Additionally, in the 
Dialogs/RootDialog.cs file, you will need to add your Dialogflow/API.AI 
key.

Lastly, you will need to update the database name, user and password in
the web.config file as well.
